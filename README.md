## Description

- My motivation behind this project was to use what I learned about express and routing to complete an application that allows a user to create, save, and retrieve notes. 
- I built this project to further enhance my understanding of Node.js, Express.js, back-end development, and routing.
- This project aimed to take starter code containing all of the front-end assets and develop the back-end that allowed the front-end to function properly.
- Through this project, I learned how to use Express.js, how routing works, how to connect the front-end to the back-end, associated functionality, and also Heroku deployment.
